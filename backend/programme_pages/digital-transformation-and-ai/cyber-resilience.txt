--- DESCRIPTION ---
You’re leveraging digital technologies to make your offer safe and seamless for your customers. But in doing so, you’re creating an increasingly complex digital ecosystem – which can expose your organisation to serious risk.

In a world where a single incident can have far-reaching consequences, resilience needs to be at the heart of your digital strategy. This programme will help you build the resilience you need to address digital challenges, such as ecosystem fragility, cyber threats, and GenAI-related privacy and ethical concerns.
