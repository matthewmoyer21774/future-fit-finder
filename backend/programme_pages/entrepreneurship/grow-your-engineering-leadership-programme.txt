## DETAILED PROGRAMME
DETAILED PROGRAMME

## Pillar 1 – Architecture & Scalability
This program is built for tomorrow’s tech leaders ready to move beyond daily execution toward becoming strategic, business-minded agents of change who drive technology as a lever for growth and boost teams to develop tomorrow’s competitive advantage. Our program will empower future tech leaders with hands-on insights into technology strategy,team leadership, scaling architecture, high-performing teams and engineering culture.

The programme is structured around 3 categories of leadership challenges translated in 10 interactive courses brought to life by frontrunning tech leaders:

Pillar 1 – Architecture & Scalability
Turning Technical Vision into Organisational Buy-In
Architecture at Every Stage of a Company
Technology Choices That Scale
Simplexity: Designing for Scale
Pillar 2 – Performance & Culture
Performance & Observability
Security & Multi-Tenancy
Pillar 3 – Strategy & Leadership
AI Integration
Scalable UX
Scaling Engineering Organizations
Future Trends in Software Architecture

Explore how emerging tech — from AI to cloud-native systems — is reshaping software. You’ll learn how to lead through technical change, design scalable systems, and build engineering cultures that grow with you.

Format: each of the ten sessions (running from September to June) follows a proven, interactive structure designed for deep learning & real-world application.

Every session embeds impact learning and great moments of networking & hospitality at the iconic Wintercircus. The course's format includes:

Guest tech leaders share a “war story” – a real technical or leadership challenge they’ve faced, followed by a class peer breakout, to engineer their solution
Class debrief & Unfolding of the case – solutions are shared the expert shares how the challenge was tackled and what they learned
In depth Q&A with the moderator, expert and reflection participants, diving deeper into decisions, trade-offs and lessons 
Informal peer exchange and frameworks to apply in your own context

Live Q&A: a participant-driven discussion that connects the case to individual realities and cross-company hurdles.

PRACTICAL INFO

The Engineering Leadership Program is a one year peer-led, practice-based leadership program for senior engineers, tech leads, and architects. 10 in-person, live sessions from September to June, held every Thursday or Friday morning, each month from September to June, including 3 exclusive networking events and a graduation ceremony and celebration.

1. Online application

Begin your journey by completing an online application. You’ll be asked to upload your CV, explain your motivation, and describe a key engineering or technical challenge you’re currently facing. This challenge will not only help us tailor your intake interview, it will also be brought during the program to connect theory with your real-world context and focus. Applications are reviewed continuously, so we recommend applying early to secure your place.

2. A personal conversation

Step two is a live, 1-hourintake interview with the program lead. Together, we’ll explore your experience,the communicated challenges and link these to the program, and leadership goals—so we can bridge with the program’s cases & peer groups,to your specific context. This ensures a highly relevant and engaging journey from day one.

3. Confirmation & registration
