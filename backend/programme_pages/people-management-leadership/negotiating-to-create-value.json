Concepts such as BATNA and ZOPA are immediately applicable and have boosted my confidence. The interactive exercises were incredibly insightful. A must for anyone looking to sharpen their negotiation skills\n\nKARIM BOUZIANI\n\nInternational Strategic Account Manager SD Worx\n\nWe negotiate all the time. The programme gave me the theoretical tools to use this insight effectively. What has impacted me most is that, during a negotiation, we can really go for a win-win situation and creatively add value for both parties. This course was particularly interesting because of the practical examples that Prof Tieleman gave and the role playing with professional actors, which allowed us to immediately apply the techniques we had learned.\n\nKATALIEN DENDOOVEN\n\nGeneral Director Wit-Gele Kruis West-Vlaanderen\n\nThe importance of good preparation at the start of a negotiation process has been an important learning point. The success of a negotiation is not only about standing up for your own interests, but also about raising the interests of the other party to the surface. When the interests of all parties are clearly revealed, the chance of a successful negotiation is much greater.\n\nCHRIS DERBOVEN\n\nStedelijk Lyceum Zuid at IKZ-coordinator\n\nThis programme changed my approach to negotiation. I’ve learned to do my homework and make sure I understand the interests of all parties before the crucial meeting begins. This allows you to create value for all stakeholders, instead of ending up in a win/lose or even lose/lose situation."

Concepts such as BATNA and ZOPA are immediately applicable and have boosted my confidence. The interactive exercises were incredibly insightful. A must for anyone looking to sharpen their negotiation skills\n\nKARIM BOUZIANI\n\nInternational Strategic Account Manager SD Worx\n\nWe negotiate all the time. The programme gave me the theoretical tools to use this insight effectively. What has impacted me most is that, during a negotiation, we can really go for a win-win situation and creatively add value for both parties. This course was particularly interesting because of the practical examples that Prof Tieleman gave and the role playing with professional actors, which allowed us to immediately apply the techniques we had learned.\n\nKATALIEN DENDOOVEN\n\nGeneral Director Wit-Gele Kruis West-Vlaanderen\n\nThe importance of good preparation at the start of a negotiation process has been an important learning point. The success of a negotiation is not only about standing up for your own interests, but also about raising the interests of the other party to the surface. When the interests of all parties are clearly revealed, the chance of a successful negotiation is much greater.\n\nCHRIS DERBOVEN\n\nStedelijk Lyceum Zuid at IKZ-coordinator\n\nThis programme changed my approach to negotiation. I’ve learned to do my homework and make sure I understand the interests of all parties before the crucial meeting begins. This allows you to create value for all stakeholders, instead of ending up in a win/lose or even lose/lose situation.\n\nFACULTY\nKatia Tieleman\n\nProfessor of Negotiation\n\nKatia Tieleman provides leading companies with the mindset, tools and approaches to turn negotiation and conflict challenges to their advantage.\n\nGET IN TOUCH!\nSien Garré\n\nProduct Manager\n\nSIEN.GARRE@VLERICK.COM\n+32 9 210 92 17\nBOOK AN APPOINTMENT"
