SUCCESS STORIES
ROB JEHOUL

R&D Manager at Vasco Group

The programme gave me a practical method to guide negotiations. Concepts such as BATNA and ZOPA are immediately applicable and have boosted my confidence. The interactive exercises were incredibly insightful. A must for anyone looking to sharpen their negotiation skills

KARIM BOUZIANI

International Strategic Account Manager SD Worx

We negotiate all the time. The programme gave me the theoretical tools to use this insight effectively. What has impacted me most is that, during a negotiation, we can really go for a win-win situation and creatively add value for both parties. This course was particularly interesting because of the practical examples that Prof Tieleman gave and the role playing with professional actors, which allowed us to immediately apply the techniques we had learned.

KATALIEN DENDOOVEN

General Director Wit-Gele Kruis West-Vlaanderen

The importance of good preparation at the start of a negotiation process has been an important learning point. The success of a negotiation is not only about standing up for your own interests, but also about raising the interests of the other party to the surface. When the interests of all parties are clearly revealed, the chance of a successful negotiation is much greater.

CHRIS DERBOVEN

Stedelijk Lyceum Zuid at IKZ-coordinator

This programme changed my approach to negotiation. I’ve learned to do my homework and make sure I understand the interests of all parties before the crucial meeting begins. This allows you to create value for all stakeholders, instead of ending up in a win/lose or even lose/lose situation.
