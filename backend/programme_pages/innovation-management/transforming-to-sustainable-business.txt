DAVID BLAZQUEZ VILA

Head of Business Strategy and Project Management at an international financial institution

Vlerick’s Transforming to Sustainable Business programme not only deepened my understanding of sustainability but it also gave me principles and practices for cultivating a sustainable mindset. Grounded in real-world examples and best practices, the content is not just theoretical but highly relevant and immediately actionable.

LAURA JONCKHEERE

Sustainability Manager Dossche Mills

The most challenging aspect of my job as a Sustainability Manager is that sustainability is still being shaped by changing stakeholder expectations, new legislation, etc. This programme gave me numerous networking opportunities and direct feedback, new insights, and inspiration on our sustainability strategy.
