Leading Lady at Fierce Management

Vlerick’s Executive Development Programme provided the academic foundation I needed to advance my career. The inspiring professors and practical insights transformed my approach to business. Within 10 months, the investment paid off. It was a life-changing experience, and I’d return in a heartbeat for an MBA!

TINNEKE DENAYER

Rare Blood Disorder Leader at Sanofi Genzyme

Every module delivered new business insights and enhanced motivation to make things happen. Our group was diverse, with people from different sectors of industry and government, as well as entrepreneurs. A dynamic and tight group of great people − and even now we are still in contact. This programme was a building block for the rest of my career.
