Teamleader Interne Projectleiding at Groep Huyzentruyt

This programme teaches you the main aspects of leadership and gives you insights into financial, strategic and business management in which the human approach is central. Great for networking and thinking out-of-the-box! The full day of coaching allows you to grow as a person and as a better leader.

YANNICK VLIEGEN

Head of Operations at Knapp Benelux

This programme has inspired me and improved my confidence. It gives you the foundations for making good decisions, and it makes you more confident that your decisions will also be accepted by your company. I can definitely recommend this programme to everyone who has just started to manage a team.




ANNELEEN QUIRYNEN

Lawyer at Stibbe/SRL

This programme gave me the intellectual framework (both hard and soft skills) to support me when taking the next step in my career. The 360° leadership report was excellent: it gave me insight into my own leadership style; and with the help of my coach and peers, I have concrete action plans to achieve my goals.

JONAS VERSTRAETE

Operations Manager Fridge at Sitra

This programme covers the major aspects of management – from strategy to finance, from people management to power and influence. It gave me the chance to expand my network and become a better leader. I’m also finding that participation in the programme opens doors, in my company and beyond. I definitely recommend it!
