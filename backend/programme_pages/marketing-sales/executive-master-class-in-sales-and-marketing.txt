DETAILED PROGRAMME

Build your knowledge and understanding in two broad phases. In the first, you dive deep into the core areas of sales and marketing. You'll learn to strategise in a way that prioritises digital - and that places sustainability at the core of your activities. 

You'll have a valuable opportunity to apply all of your learning to a strategic project in your own organisation.

And then in the second phase, you deepen your knowledge by choosing electives that best align with the needs of your company and your role. Choose, for example, the Sales Path, to enhance your understanding of Sales Management and Self-Leadership. Or follow the Marketing Path and dive deep into Digital Marketing. If you’d rather build your own path, we’d be happy to help you select your electives. (FYI: If you prefer not to take the electives and the strategic project, take a look at Excellence in Sales and Marketing).
