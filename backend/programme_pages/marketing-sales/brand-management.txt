Head of Marketing Department at KBC Bank & Insurance

I had the pleasure of participating in an inspiring yet hands-on learning journey on how to build and manage successful brands. During this programme, a variety of perspectives, models and techniques were explained and illustrated by practical examples. There was also room for reflection on how these techniques can be applied to everyone’s own business, which made the learnings actionable. 

ANDY VAN DEN BERGHE

Brand Manager, Benelux at Swatch Group

At the rate that new market trends appear – and with the challenges that they pose to marketing and communication – it’s really necessary to be well prepared. This programme offers a broad vision and guides you in tackling current obstacles and anticipating new pitfalls. Today’s theory can be perfectly put into practice tomorrow.
