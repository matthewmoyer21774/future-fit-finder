SUCCESS STORIES
ELISABETH DE WAELE

Head of Clinical Nutrition Department Intensivist UZ Brussel

In addition to gaining new insights, I wanted to be inspired. I wanted to acquire new skills and tips & tricks from the pros. I now understand better where my talents lie and which subjects, such as innovation and people management, fascinate me. I am also better able to recognise and analyze situations or challenges and approach them in a more structured way. 

AN BAEL

Paediatric Nephrologist at ZNA

One particular thing I learned is that to tackle the sticking points in paediatrics, you have to find like-minded people. The great advantage of the Vlerick programme is the network. Partly thanks to the course, I am now a member of many paediatric associations in Flanders and Belgium. It’s quite time-consuming, but probably the only way to really achieve something. I now feel like I really know what I’m talking about in several areas.

And all these challenges come with financial, strategic, organisational and human consequences. 

On this 15-day programme for doctors and hospital employees, you live and learn various aspects of hospital management – so you can leap confidently into contributing to your hospital’s policy.

SUCCESS STORIES
ELISABETH DE WAELE

Head of Clinical Nutrition Department Intensivist UZ Brussel

In addition to gaining new insights, I wanted to be inspired. I wanted to acquire new skills and tips & tricks from the pros. I now understand better where my talents lie and which subjects, such as innovation and people management, fascinate me. I am also better able to recognise and analyze situations or challenges and approach them in a more structured way. 

AN BAEL

Paediatric Nephrologist at ZNA

One particular thing I learned is that to tackle the sticking points in paediatrics, you have to find like-minded people. The great advantage of the Vlerick programme is the network. Partly thanks to the course, I am now a member of many paediatric associations in Flanders and Belgium. It’s quite time-consuming, but probably the only way to really achieve something. I now feel like I really know what I’m talking about in several areas.
