I wanted to acquire new skills and tips & tricks from the pros. I now understand better where my talents lie and which subjects, such as innovation and people management, fascinate me. I am also better able to recognise and analyze situations or challenges and approach them in a more structured way. \n\nAN BAEL\n\nPaediatric Nephrologist at ZNA\n\nOne particular thing I learned is that to tackle the sticking points in paediatrics, you have to find like-minded people. The great advantage of the Vlerick programme is the network. Partly thanks to the course, I am now a member of many paediatric associations in Flanders and Belgium. It’s quite time-consuming, but probably the only way to really achieve something. I now feel like I really know what I’m talking about in several areas."

I wanted to acquire new skills and tips & tricks from the pros. I now understand better where my talents lie and which subjects, such as innovation and people management, fascinate me. I am also better able to recognise and analyze situations or challenges and approach them in a more structured way. \n\nAN BAEL\n\nPaediatric Nephrologist at ZNA\n\nOne particular thing I learned is that to tackle the sticking points in paediatrics, you have to find like-minded people. The great advantage of the Vlerick programme is the network. Partly thanks to the course, I am now a member of many paediatric associations in Flanders and Belgium. It’s quite time-consuming, but probably the only way to really achieve something. I now feel like I really know what I’m talking about in several areas. \n\nFACULTY\nBrecht Cardoen\n\nProfessor of Operations Management\n\nBrecht Cardoen, director of the Executive PhD programme, introduces you to decision science and process analytics – and their impact on manufacturing and service operations. \n\nWalter Van Dyck\n\nProfessor of Innovation Management\n\nWalter Van Dyck supports global science and technology companies with strategic innovation management.\n\nWouter De Maeseneire\n\nProfessor of Corporate Finance\n\nWouter De Maeseneire is passionate about explaining financial management principles by linking finance to business models and strategies.\n\nKurt Verweire\n\nProfessor of Strategy\n\nKurt Verweire is a specialist in helping companies to develop and implement winning business strategies. \n\nKatleen De Stobbeleir\n\nProfessor of Leadership\n\nKatleen De Stobbeleir is inspired by leaders who stand up and speak – and she is passionate about those who have the courage to sit and listen.\n\nBarney Jordaan\n\nHonorary Professor of Negotiation\n\nBarney Jordaan is an expert in negotiation and conflict leadership – and helps organisations build effective negotiation strategies.\n\nKatrien Kesteloot\n\nVisiting Professor of Healthcare\n\nKatrien Kesteloot is an expert in financial management in healthcare, health economics and health financing systems.\n\nXavier Baeten\n\nProfessor of Reward & Sustainability\n\nXavier Baeten is highlighting the vital role of rewarding in helping organisations deliver their strategy and gain competitive advantage.\n\nStijn Viaene\n\nProfessor of Digital Transformation\n\nStijn Viaene is dedicated to helping executives transform their enterprises for a digital world.\n\nKarlien Vanderheyden\n\nProfessor of Organisational Behaviour\n\nKarlien Vanderheyden focuses on how individuals can impact an organisation’s people, processes and performance.\n\nGET IN TOUCH!\nAnnelies Claeys\n\nInnovation manager\n\nANNELIES.CLAEYS@VLERICK.COM\n+32 9 210 98 04\nBOOK AN APPOINTMENT"
