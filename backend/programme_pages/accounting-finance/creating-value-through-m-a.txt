The quality of the programme is very high, and the focus on real-life cases and the practical aspects of the M&A process makes it attractive for professionals and practitioners.

The course has given me new insights, we revisited known formulas and discussed new approaches. Professors and guest speakers provided an academic foundation with a clear link to practice. Now I am successfully using the techniques in our firm. The effort the programme demands is more than worth it.
