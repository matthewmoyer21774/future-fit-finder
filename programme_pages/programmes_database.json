It has been an intellectually enriching and stimulating experience. The programme is taught by skilled lecturers – true experts with exceptional knowledge to share. The programme is intended to be as interactive as possible.\n\nJULIE GOSSEN\n\nResponsible Investment Specialist at Degroof Petercam Asset Management\n\nThe networking opportunities were exceptional – with 2-day sessions in Ghent and Leuven. The programme enabled everyone to exchange insights and build strong bonds with our peers. The very diverse group of participants made this journey even more enriching, as everyone had a different take on how to apply the newly acquired knowledge to their respective careers.\n\nBJORN DE VRIESE\n\nJurist and Lecturer in Law at Hogeschool Ghent\n\nI chose Vlerick because it offers this flagship programme in the Benelux region, and I found no alternative that matched its quality. The modules – excellently designed, structured and delivered – cover a wide range of themes within the financial world.\n\nVlerick is a life-changing experience in my lifelong learning journey and career. I have gained a wealth of new knowledge for myself, not to mention the professional contacts and beautiful friendships."

And the network you build is invaluable.\n\nCHRISTOPHE BOEXSTAENS\n\nManager at ALU-XTRA\n\nThe Challenge Bootcamp gave me the self-confidence and self-awareness to turn my weaknesses into strengths. My communication, leadership, innovation, organisational, sales and overall management skills have all improved. I now dare to say I am an entrepreneur. I even have to hold back a little, because the organisation cannot keep up with me! Thanks to this programme, I know I’ll be able to deliver on my long-term objectives.\n\nCÉLINE CORTVRIENDT\n\nManager Cortvriendt Tegels NV\n\nThe programme gets you out of your comfort zone, which motivated me to do things better. In the past we sometimes used to be behind the curve, but now I plan– I made a list of action points for the coming year, for example. I'm also more aware of how important focus is. The discussions with other participants were really valuable too."

Being able to work alongside like-minded participants is really valuable. You also get to stand back and evaluate your own business and approaches. And the network you build is invaluable.\n\nCHRISTOPHE BOEXSTAENS\n\nManager at ALU-XTRA\n\nThe Challenge Bootcamp gave me the self-confidence and self-awareness to turn my weaknesses into strengths. My communication, leadership, innovation, organisational, sales and overall management skills have all improved. I now dare to say I am an entrepreneur. I even have to hold back a little, because the organisation cannot keep up with me! Thanks to this programme, I know I’ll be able to deliver on my long-term objectives.\n\nCÉLINE CORTVRIENDT\n\nManager Cortvriendt Tegels NV\n\nThe programme gets you out of your comfort zone, which motivated me to do things better. In the past we sometimes used to be behind the curve, but now I plan– I made a list of action points for the coming year, for example. I'm also more aware of how important focus is. The discussions with other participants were really valuable too.\n\nFACULTY\nMiguel Meuleman\n\nProfessor of Entrepreneurship\n\nProf. Dr. Miguel Meuleman specialises in business models, growth strategies and financing of growing companies.

            "DETAILED PROGRAMME\n\nThe programme focuses on two crucial elements: the family and the assets. In terms of family, we are referring to succession, previous/current/next generations, family cohesion and dynamics, active versus non-active family members, family governance, development of human capital, purpose and more. In relation to assets, our focus is on wealth planning & management, direct and indirect investment strategies, philanthropy, impact investing, etc. This programme takes a deep-dive into how a professionally managed Family Office aims to amass different types of capital: financial, but also human, intellectual, social and emotional. Explicit attention is devoted to the added societal value that a Family Office can deliver alongside its capital management (through a purpose-driven strategy).\n\nModule 1 – The Family Office approach: family & assets\n\nAn introduction to the Family Office landscape in Belgium and abroad. When do you start a Family Office? What is the goal of a Family Office? How do you organise a Family Office? Which models are there? What are the essential governance aspects of a Family Office? What types of capital can a Family Office help to develop? The emphasis lies on different practical examples, both local and international. Alongside this, specific attention is paid to networks. \n\nModule 2 – Family dynamics and emotions: how do you align different interests and determine your purpose-driven Family Office strategy? \n\nFamilies grow with each new generation. The risk of family assets being destroyed has little to do with money, but primarily with worsening relations as a result of other priorities and a lack of internal alignment. How can you align complex dynamics and varying objectives, and transform these into a shared, purpose-driven Family Office strategy? How can you establish structures and practices to move from an individual (‘I’) to a collective (‘we’) vision, so that the assets can remain across the generations in the family? This module is particularly relevant from a societal perspective and focuses on the family within the Family Office.\n\nModule 3 – Investment options and organisation of financial assets across the generations\n\nHealthy financial management of assets is an essential task for a Family Office. What are the pros and cons of different investment options (e.g. direct versus indirect investments, public versus private markets, bonds versus shares, impact investing), and how do you optimise the spread of your assets? How do you implement an investment strategy? Do you work with partners or organise everything in-house? How do you translate a purpose-driven Family Office strategy into an investment strategy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of different investment options?\n\nModule 4 – (Cross-generational) Governance structure, communication and lifecycle of a Family Office\n\nWhat are the foundations of a professional governance structure? What steps are possible to safeguard a professional governance structure for a Family Office? How can you establish healthy decision-making structures to align different interests? We look at the governing bodies of a Family Office, including the family council, board of directors, investment committee and the Family Office management team. We deep-dive into the organisation of these bodies, paying attention to formal structures (e.g. rules around selection of members, reward policy), informal structures and practices (e.g. rituals and traditions). Additionally, we pay specific attention to the development of a Family Office's human, intellectual and social capital. We look in depth at culture management across generations.\n\nModule 5 – Managing direct investments\n\nDirect investment in businesses is an important strategy to create value as an investor. What are the challenges around directly investing in different types of businesses (e.g. start-ups versus buy-outs)? How can you structure such investments? What role can a holding company play? What governance-related challenges are there with such investments? What is the competitive advantage of a Family Office over other direct investors?\n\nModule 6 – Intervision\n\nThe participants present their long-term Family Office strategy and related actions. What insights have they gained? How are they going to get to work on this? What is their action plan?",

How do you implement an investment strategy? Do you work with partners or organise everything in-house? How do you translate a purpose-driven Family Office strategy into an investment strategy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of different investment options?\n\nModule 4 – (Cross-generational) Governance structure, communication and lifecycle of a Family Office\n\nWhat are the foundations of a professional governance structure? What steps are possible to safeguard a professional governance structure for a Family Office? How can you establish healthy decision-making structures to align different interests? We look at the governing bodies of a Family Office, including the family council, board of directors, investment committee and the Family Office management team. We deep-dive into the organisation of these bodies, paying attention to formal structures (e.g. rules around selection of members, reward policy), informal structures and practices (e.g. rituals and traditions). Additionally, we pay specific attention to the development of a Family Office's human, intellectual and social capital. We look in depth at culture management across generations.\n\nModule 5 – Managing direct investments\n\nDirect investment in businesses is an important strategy to create value as an investor. What are the challenges around directly investing in different types of businesses (e.g. start-ups versus buy-outs)? How can you structure such investments? What role can a holding company play? What governance-related challenges are there with such investments? What is the competitive advantage of a Family Office over other direct investors?\n\nModule 6 – Intervision\n\nThe participants present their long-term Family Office strategy and related actions. What insights have they gained? How are they going to get to work on this? What is their action plan?",
            "DETAILED PROGRAMME",
            "The programme focuses on two crucial elements: the family and the assets. In terms of family, we are referring to succession, previous/current/next generations, family cohesion and dynamics, active versus non-active family members, family governance, development of human capital, purpose and more. In relation to assets, our focus is on wealth planning & management, direct and indirect investment strategies, philanthropy, impact investing, etc. This programme takes a deep-dive into how a professionally managed Family Office aims to amass different types of capital: financial, but also human, intellectual, social and emotional. Explicit attention is devoted to the added societal value that a Family Office can deliver alongside its capital management (through a purpose-driven strategy).\n\nModule 1 – The Family Office approach: family & assets\n\nAn introduction to the Family Office landscape in Belgium and abroad. When do you start a Family Office? What is the goal of a Family Office? How do you organise a Family Office? Which models are there? What are the essential governance aspects of a Family Office? What types of capital can a Family Office help to develop? The emphasis lies on different practical examples, both local and international. Alongside this, specific attention is paid to networks. \n\nModule 2 – Family dynamics and emotions: how do you align different interests and determine your purpose-driven Family Office strategy? \n\nFamilies grow with each new generation. The risk of family assets being destroyed has little to do with money, but primarily with worsening relations as a result of other priorities and a lack of internal alignment. How can you align complex dynamics and varying objectives, and transform these into a shared, purpose-driven Family Office strategy? How can you establish structures and practices to move from an individual (‘I’) to a collective (‘we’) vision, so that the assets can remain across the generations in the family? This module is particularly relevant from a societal perspective and focuses on the family within the Family Office.\n\nModule 3 – Investment options and organisation of financial assets across the generations\n\nHealthy financial management of assets is an essential task for a Family Office. What are the pros and cons of different investment options (e.g. direct versus indirect investments, public versus private markets, bonds versus shares, impact investing), and how do you optimise the spread of your assets? How do you implement an investment strategy? Do you work with partners or organise everything in-house? How do you translate a purpose-driven Family Office strategy into an investment strategy?

The Advanced Management Programme aims for precisely that: lasting impact. Think of it as a transformative general management programme for senior managers. In synergy with a group of high-calibre participants, we will redefine your leadership role and strategic mindset at different levels.\n\nThe Advanced Management Programme is founded on two pillars – strategic decision-making and your role as a leader. The programme takes you on a journey that reframes your entire way of thinking and your approach to leadership and makes them future-proof.\n\nModule 1: Your strategic arena\n\nWe begin with a sharp focus on the winning strategy for your business environment. We outline the key elements needed to formulate that strategy effectively. What are the critical decisions you need to make when selecting your strategy? How do you craft a winning strategy? And how do you set yourself apart from other players in the same strategic arena?\n\nThe final part of this module focuses on strategy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. What makes or breaks a successful strategic implementation? You’ll work with tools like strategy maps and scorecards, applying them to your own company during a simulation. This way, you can measure and track the success of your strategy.\n\nAfter completing this module, you will meet with your sounding board group for an initial discussion on the scope of your strategic project.\n\nModule 2: High-performance leadership \n\nIn this module, you will reflect on your leadership role. What does impact mean, and how much influence do you have as a leader? This module also marks the start of your 360° feedback process, which you will later discuss with your sounding board group and a Vlerick professor. Additionally, we will explore organisational culture and structure.\n\nIn the second part, we will discuss how to drive change within your company. You will be introduced to a change model based on six organisational ‘batteries’. This model will help you manage both the tangible and intangible aspects of change more effectively.\n\nAfterwards, you will receive your first project coaching from our faculty.\n\nModule 3: Decision-making impact \n\nDuring the third module, you will dive into the various aspects of corporate finance essential for every senior executive—such as raising capital, capital budgeting, and business valuation. You will then sharpen your negotiation skills and develop a framework that elevates your negotiations to true win-win deals.\n\nAfter this module, you will have dedicated time to meet with your advisory group. You can also take advantage of additional one-on-one project coaching from our faculty.\n\nModule 4: Navigating trends \n\nIn this module, we explore how you, as a leader, can respond to emerging global trends. We take a closer look at the impact of sustainability and digitalisation, summarising key sustainability models for you. Next, we address the implementation challenges and what they mean for your organisation.\n\nWe also focus on digital strategy, as the impact of digital technology cannot be underestimated. You will learn how to tackle digital challenges and use them to enhance your organisation’s competitiveness.\n\nOn the final day of this module, we will cover strategic integration—bringing together all strategic models in a final, concluding case study.\n\nClosing module\n\nWe wrap up the programme in style with a graduation dinner. After completing your journey, you can schedule a one-on-one session with your Vlerick professor at a time of your choosing. The goal? To translate your insights into practice and unlock new opportunities to take your business to the next level"

            "DETAILED PROGRAMME\n\nIn a world where change is the only constant, you must challenge your thinking and broaden your strategic perspective, for yourself and your company. The Advanced Management Programme aims for precisely that: lasting impact. Think of it as a transformative general management programme for senior managers. In synergy with a group of high-calibre participants, we will redefine your leadership role and strategic mindset at different levels.\n\nThe Advanced Management Programme is founded on two pillars – strategic decision-making and your role as a leader. The programme takes you on a journey that reframes your entire way of thinking and your approach to leadership and makes them future-proof.\n\nModule 1: Your strategic arena\n\nWe begin with a sharp focus on the winning strategy for your business environment. We outline the key elements needed to formulate that strategy effectively. What are the critical decisions you need to make when selecting your strategy? How do you craft a winning strategy? And how do you set yourself apart from other players in the same strategic arena?\n\nThe final part of this module focuses on strategy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. What makes or breaks a successful strategic implementation? You’ll work with tools like strategy maps and scorecards, applying them to your own company during a simulation. This way, you can measure and track the success of your strategy.\n\nAfter completing this module, you will meet with your sounding board group for an initial discussion on the scope of your strategic project.\n\nModule 2: High-performance leadership \n\nIn this module, you will reflect on your leadership role. What does impact mean, and how much influence do you have as a leader? This module also marks the start of your 360° feedback process, which you will later discuss with your sounding board group and a Vlerick professor. Additionally, we will explore organisational culture and structure.\n\nIn the second part, we will discuss how to drive change within your company. You will be introduced to a change model based on six organisational ‘batteries’. This model will help you manage both the tangible and intangible aspects of change more effectively.\n\nAfterwards, you will receive your first project coaching from our faculty.\n\nModule 3: Decision-making impact \n\nDuring the third module, you will dive into the various aspects of corporate finance essential for every senior executive—such as raising capital, capital budgeting, and business valuation. You will then sharpen your negotiation skills and develop a framework that elevates your negotiations to true win-win deals.\n\nAfter this module, you will have dedicated time to meet with your advisory group. You can also take advantage of additional one-on-one project coaching from our faculty.\n\nModule 4: Navigating trends \n\nIn this module, we explore how you, as a leader, can respond to emerging global trends. We take a closer look at the impact of sustainability and digitalisation, summarising key sustainability models for you. Next, we address the implementation challenges and what they mean for your organisation.\n\nWe also focus on digital strategy, as the impact of digital technology cannot be underestimated. You will learn how to tackle digital challenges and use them to enhance your organisation’s competitiveness.\n\nOn the final day of this module, we will cover strategic integration—bringing together all strategic models in a final, concluding case study.\n\nClosing module\n\nWe wrap up the programme in style with a graduation dinner. After completing your journey, you can schedule a one-on-one session with your Vlerick professor at a time of your choosing. The goal? To translate your insights into practice and unlock new opportunities to take your business to the next level",

Which means you need leadership skills that can drive competitive advantage, no matter what the future holds. Over the course of one year, this 16-day general management programme is a transformative experience that allows you to reframe your leadership role and strategic thinking. \n\nIf you’re looking for a senior management programme that opens your mind, boosts effectiveness and transforms your leadership approach, the Advanced Management Programme is for you.\n\n<\nDetailed programmeWhy this programmeWho should attendPractical infoFees and financingFaculty\nBROCHURE\nAPPLY\nDETAILED PROGRAMME\n\nIn a world where change is the only constant, you must challenge your thinking and broaden your strategic perspective, for yourself and your company. The Advanced Management Programme aims for precisely that: lasting impact. Think of it as a transformative general management programme for senior managers. In synergy with a group of high-calibre participants, we will redefine your leadership role and strategic mindset at different levels.\n\nThe Advanced Management Programme is founded on two pillars – strategic decision-making and your role as a leader. The programme takes you on a journey that reframes your entire way of thinking and your approach to leadership and makes them future-proof.\n\nModule 1: Your strategic arena\n\nWe begin with a sharp focus on the winning strategy for your business environment. We outline the key elements needed to formulate that strategy effectively. What are the critical decisions you need to make when selecting your strategy? How do you craft a winning strategy? And how do you set yourself apart from other players in the same strategic arena?\n\nThe final part of this module focuses on strategy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. What makes or breaks a successful strategic implementation? You’ll work with tools like strategy maps and scorecards, applying them to your own company during a simulation. This way, you can measure and track the success of your strategy.\n\nAfter completing this module, you will meet with your sounding board group for an initial discussion on the scope of your strategic project.\n\nModule 2: High-performance leadership \n\nIn this module, you will reflect on your leadership role. What does impact mean, and how much influence do you have as a leader? This module also marks the start of your 360° feedback process, which you will later discuss with your sounding board group and a Vlerick professor. Additionally, we will explore organisational culture and structure.\n\nIn the second part, we will discuss how to drive change within your company. You will be introduced to a change model based on six organisational ‘batteries’. This model will help you manage both the tangible and intangible aspects of change more effectively.\n\nAfterwards, you will receive your first project coaching from our faculty.\n\nModule 3: Decision-making impact \n\nDuring the third module, you will dive into the various aspects of corporate finance essential for every senior executive—such as raising capital, capital budgeting, and business valuation. You will then sharpen your negotiation skills and develop a framework that elevates your negotiations to true win-win deals.\n\nAfter this module, you will have dedicated time to meet with your advisory group. You can also take advantage of additional one-on-one project coaching from our faculty.\n\nModule 4: Navigating trends \n\nIn this module, we explore how you, as a leader, can respond to emerging global trends. We take a closer look at the impact of sustainability and digitalisation, summarising key sustainability models for you. Next, we address the implementation challenges and what they mean for your organisation.\n\nWe also focus on digital strategy, as the impact of digital technology cannot be underestimated. You will learn how to tackle digital challenges and use them to enhance your organisation’s competitiveness.\n\nOn the final day of this module, we will cover strategic integration—bringing together all strategic models in a final, concluding case study.\n\nClosing module\n\nWe wrap up the programme in style with a graduation dinner. After completing your journey, you can schedule a one-on-one session with your Vlerick professor at a time of your choosing. The goal? To translate your insights into practice and unlock new opportunities to take your business to the next level\n\nUPCOMING EDITION\nFINANCING YOUR PROGRAMME\nStarts 24 November 2026\n16 days\nBrussels, Ghent\n€19,995 (excl. 21% VAT)\nDutch\nSCHEDULE\nAPPLY\nWHY THIS PROGRAMME\nLearn to think and act strategically\nFinetune your leadership ability and become a driver of positive change \nStrengthen your financial knowledge and insights\nCreate impact in your own company by tackling a concrete strategic challenge within your organisation—with a clear focus on the future\nGain expertise in proven Vlerick tools such as the strategic toolkit, the digital maturity scan, and the Vlerick change model—and apply them to your strategic project\nUnderstand how to integrate different management disciplines within your strategic framework\nBuild a lifelong, diverse network with your fellow participants – and learn from their experiences  \nAfter graduating from this programme, you are entitled to join our alumni network.

I wanted to acquire new skills and tips & tricks from the pros. I now understand better where my talents lie and which subjects, such as innovation and people management, fascinate me. I am also better able to recognise and analyze situations or challenges and approach them in a more structured way. \n\nAN BAEL\n\nPaediatric Nephrologist at ZNA\n\nOne particular thing I learned is that to tackle the sticking points in paediatrics, you have to find like-minded people. The great advantage of the Vlerick programme is the network. Partly thanks to the course, I am now a member of many paediatric associations in Flanders and Belgium.

The great advantage of the Vlerick programme is the network. Partly thanks to the course, I am now a member of many paediatric associations in Flanders and Belgium. It’s quite time-consuming, but probably the only way to really achieve something.

Concepts such as BATNA and ZOPA are immediately applicable and have boosted my confidence. The interactive exercises were incredibly insightful. A must for anyone looking to sharpen their negotiation skills\n\nKARIM BOUZIANI\n\nInternational Strategic Account Manager SD Worx\n\nWe negotiate all the time. The programme gave me the theoretical tools to use this insight effectively. What has impacted me most is that, during a negotiation, we can really go for a win-win situation and creatively add value for both parties. This course was particularly interesting because of the practical examples that Prof Tieleman gave and the role playing with professional actors, which allowed us to immediately apply the techniques we had learned.\n\nKATALIEN DENDOOVEN\n\nGeneral Director Wit-Gele Kruis West-Vlaanderen\n\nThe importance of good preparation at the start of a negotiation process has been an important learning point. The success of a negotiation is not only about standing up for your own interests, but also about raising the interests of the other party to the surface. When the interests of all parties are clearly revealed, the chance of a successful negotiation is much greater.\n\nCHRIS DERBOVEN\n\nStedelijk Lyceum Zuid at IKZ-coordinator\n\nThis programme changed my approach to negotiation. I’ve learned to do my homework and make sure I understand the interests of all parties before the crucial meeting begins. This allows you to create value for all stakeholders, instead of ending up in a win/lose or even lose/lose situation."

Concepts such as BATNA and ZOPA are immediately applicable and have boosted my confidence. The interactive exercises were incredibly insightful. A must for anyone looking to sharpen their negotiation skills\n\nKARIM BOUZIANI\n\nInternational Strategic Account Manager SD Worx\n\nWe negotiate all the time. The programme gave me the theoretical tools to use this insight effectively. What has impacted me most is that, during a negotiation, we can really go for a win-win situation and creatively add value for both parties. This course was particularly interesting because of the practical examples that Prof Tieleman gave and the role playing with professional actors, which allowed us to immediately apply the techniques we had learned.\n\nKATALIEN DENDOOVEN\n\nGeneral Director Wit-Gele Kruis West-Vlaanderen\n\nThe importance of good preparation at the start of a negotiation process has been an important learning point. The success of a negotiation is not only about standing up for your own interests, but also about raising the interests of the other party to the surface. When the interests of all parties are clearly revealed, the chance of a successful negotiation is much greater.\n\nCHRIS DERBOVEN\n\nStedelijk Lyceum Zuid at IKZ-coordinator\n\nThis programme changed my approach to negotiation. I’ve learned to do my homework and make sure I understand the interests of all parties before the crucial meeting begins. This allows you to create value for all stakeholders, instead of ending up in a win/lose or even lose/lose situation.\n\nFACULTY\nKatia Tieleman\n\nProfessor of Negotiation\n\nKatia Tieleman provides leading companies with the mindset, tools and approaches to turn negotiation and conflict challenges to their advantage.\n\nGET IN TOUCH!\nSien Garré\n\nProduct Manager\n\nSIEN.GARRE@VLERICK.COM\n+32 9 210 92 17\nBOOK AN APPOINTMENT"

You can access this online training programme on a variety of devices, and the fact that it’s online means that you can use it flexibly at your convenience.
