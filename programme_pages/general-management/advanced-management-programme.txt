DETAILED PROGRAMME

## Module 1: Your strategic arena
In a world where change is the only constant, you must challenge your thinking and broaden your strategic perspective, for yourself and your company. The Advanced Management Programme aims for precisely that: lasting impact. Think of it as a transformative general management programme for senior managers. In synergy with a group of high-calibre participants, we will redefine your leadership role and strategic mindset at different levels.

The Advanced Management Programme is founded on two pillars – strategic decision-making and your role as a leader. The programme takes you on a journey that reframes your entire way of thinking and your approach to leadership and makes them future-proof.

Module 1: Your strategic arena

We begin with a sharp focus on the winning strategy for your business environment. We outline the key elements needed to formulate that strategy effectively. What are the critical decisions you need to make when selecting your strategy? How do you craft a winning strategy? And how do you set yourself apart from other players in the same strategic arena?

The final part of this module focuses on strategy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. What makes or breaks a successful strategic implementation? You’ll work with tools like strategy maps and scorecards, applying them to your own company during a simulation. This way, you can measure and track the success of your strategy.

After completing this module, you will meet with your sounding board group for an initial discussion on the scope of your strategic project.

Module 2: High-performance leadership 

In this module, you will reflect on your leadership role. What does impact mean, and how much influence do you have as a leader? This module also marks the start of your 360° feedback process, which you will later discuss with your sounding board group and a Vlerick professor. Additionally, we will explore organisational culture and structure.

In the second part, we will discuss how to drive change within your company. You will be introduced to a change model based on six organisational ‘batteries’. This model will help you manage both the tangible and intangible aspects of change more effectively.

Afterwards, you will receive your first project coaching from our faculty.

Module 3: Decision-making impact 

During the third module, you will dive into the various aspects of corporate finance essential for every senior executive—such as raising capital, capital budgeting, and business valuation. You will then sharpen your negotiation skills and develop a framework that elevates your negotiations to true win-win deals.

After this module, you will have dedicated time to meet with your advisory group. You can also take advantage of additional one-on-one project coaching from our faculty.

Module 4: Navigating trends 

In this module, we explore how you, as a leader, can respond to emerging global trends. We take a closer look at the impact of sustainability and digitalisation, summarising key sustainability models for you. Next, we address the implementation challenges and what they mean for your organisation.

We also focus on digital strategy, as the impact of digital technology cannot be underestimated. You will learn how to tackle digital challenges and use them to enhance your organisation’s competitiveness.

On the final day of this module, we will cover strategic integration—bringing together all strategic models in a final, concluding case study.

Closing module

We wrap up the programme in style with a graduation dinner. After completing your journey, you can schedule a one-on-one session with your Vlerick professor at a time of your choosing. The goal? To translate your insights into practice and unlock new opportunities to take your business to the next level

Over the course of one year, this 16-day general management programme is a transformative experience that allows you to reframe your leadership role and strategic thinking. 

If you’re looking for a senior management programme that opens your mind, boosts effectiveness and transforms your leadership approach, the Advanced Management Programme is for you.

DETAILED PROGRAMME

In a world where change is the only constant, you must challenge your thinking and broaden your strategic perspective, for yourself and your company. The Advanced Management Programme aims for precisely that: lasting impact. Think of it as a transformative general management programme for senior managers. In synergy with a group of high-calibre participants, we will redefine your leadership role and strategic mindset at different levels.

The Advanced Management Programme is founded on two pillars – strategic decision-making and your role as a leader. The programme takes you on a journey that reframes your entire way of thinking and your approach to leadership and makes them future-proof.

Module 1: Your strategic arena

We begin with a sharp focus on the winning strategy for your business environment. We outline the key elements needed to formulate that strategy effectively. What are the critical decisions you need to make when selecting your strategy? How do you craft a winning strategy? And how do you set yourself apart from other players in the same strategic arena?

The final part of this module focuses on strategy implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. What makes or breaks a successful strategic implementation? You’ll work with tools like strategy maps and scorecards, applying them to your own company during a simulation. This way, you can measure and track the success of your strategy.

After completing this module, you will meet with your sounding board group for an initial discussion on the scope of your strategic project.

Module 2: High-performance leadership 

In this module, you will reflect on your leadership role. What does impact mean, and how much influence do you have as a leader? This module also marks the start of your 360° feedback process, which you will later discuss with your sounding board group and a Vlerick professor. Additionally, we will explore organisational culture and structure.

In the second part, we will discuss how to drive change within your company. You will be introduced to a change model based on six organisational ‘batteries’. This model will help you manage both the tangible and intangible aspects of change more effectively.

Afterwards, you will receive your first project coaching from our faculty.

Module 3: Decision-making impact 

During the third module, you will dive into the various aspects of corporate finance essential for every senior executive—such as raising capital, capital budgeting, and business valuation. You will then sharpen your negotiation skills and develop a framework that elevates your negotiations to true win-win deals.

After this module, you will have dedicated time to meet with your advisory group. You can also take advantage of additional one-on-one project coaching from our faculty.

Module 4: Navigating trends 

In this module, we explore how you, as a leader, can respond to emerging global trends. We take a closer look at the impact of sustainability and digitalisation, summarising key sustainability models for you. Next, we address the implementation challenges and what they mean for your organisation.

We also focus on digital strategy, as the impact of digital technology cannot be underestimated. You will learn how to tackle digital challenges and use them to enhance your organisation’s competitiveness.

On the final day of this module, we will cover strategic integration—bringing together all strategic models in a final, concluding case study.

Closing module

We wrap up the programme in style with a graduation dinner. After completing your journey, you can schedule a one-on-one session with your Vlerick professor at a time of your choosing. The goal? To translate your insights into practice and unlock new opportunities to take your business to the next level
