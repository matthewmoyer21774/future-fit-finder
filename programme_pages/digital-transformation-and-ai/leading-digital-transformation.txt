GREET DE BONDT

Head of Digital Customer Experience D'Ieteren

I strongly believe that embracing digital in a smart way can improve the customer experience and optimise business processes. The programme really confirmed that there is no magic formula for increasing an organisation’s digital maturity. We discovered the variety of tasks, points of view, and number of people that should be involved to get to a good result. The main learning lesson is the necessity of a roadmap for the entire organisation – and this programme provided the tools.




WOUTER VAN ISTERDAEL

Business Unit Director IT Aldi Belgium

It was fascinating to talk to people active in diverse sectors and yet all facing the same issues. The programme also inspired me on a technological level – seeing examples set by the industry pioneers, the technological possibilities, and hearing the guest lecturers who have lived such a transformation first-hand and were eager to share their experiences with the group. Read more on Wouter's Vlerick experience.

TAMARA LIEVENS

Head of IT @MPET

In my current role as Head of IT I have the ability to engage at both the operational and the strategic level. This programme’s mix of theory, energy scan and tips & tools and the shared experiences in implementing digital transformations in practice has given me lots of insights and inspiration. One of the first actions taken in the organisation was to categorise the roadmap according to the four different types of Leading Digital Transformation.

ALEXANDRA KOLODINA

Extended Reality Lead EMEA Medtronic

Working in change management and innovation, I looked for a programme with an end-to-end vision and a ‘people’ aspect beyond ‘digital’. The participants all face similar challenges, and it’s a relief to hear that you’re not alone. Leading Digital Transformation isn’t easy, but it starts with understanding your company’s culture and finding the right leadership styles. Combined with agility and the courage to take risks.
