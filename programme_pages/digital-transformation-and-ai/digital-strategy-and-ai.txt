I would definitely recommend Digital Strategy and AI to others. It is built on tons of research and experience – and its applicability is unique. I've been a consultant in IT for 12 years now – the programme has shown me many opportunities to work on digital strategy with my clients as well as with my own employer. I also learned from, and was inspired by, the other participants. 

MARTINA BALAZSOVA

Managing Partner at Nova Consultancies

“I joined the Digital Strategy and AI programme because it’s important to stay up-to-date on hot topics. I’ve applied everything I learned – but the most useful element was the real business cases we discussed in class. I found my learning experience to be practical, professional and quite profound.”
