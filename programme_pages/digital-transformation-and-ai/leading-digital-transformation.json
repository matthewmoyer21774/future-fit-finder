            "content": "SUCCESS STORIES\nGREET DE BONDT\n\nHead of Digital Customer Experience D'Ieteren\n\nI strongly believe that embracing digital in a smart way can improve the customer experience and optimise business processes. The programme really confirmed that there is no magic formula for increasing an organisation’s digital maturity. We discovered the variety of tasks, points of view, and number of people that should be involved to get to a good result. The main learning lesson is the necessity of a roadmap for the entire organisation – and this programme provided the tools.\n\n\n\n\nWOUTER VAN ISTERDAEL\n\nBusiness Unit Director IT Aldi Belgium\n\nIt was fascinating to talk to people active in diverse sectors and yet all facing the same issues. The programme also inspired me on a technological level – seeing examples set by the industry pioneers, the technological possibilities, and hearing the guest lecturers who have lived such a transformation first-hand and were eager to share their experiences with the group. Read more on Wouter's Vlerick experience.\n\nTAMARA LIEVENS\n\nHead of IT @MPET\n\nIn my current role as Head of IT I have the ability to engage at both the operational and the strategic level. This programme’s mix of theory, energy scan and tips & tools and the shared experiences in implementing digital transformations in practice has given me lots of insights and inspiration. One of the first actions taken in the organisation was to categorise the roadmap according to the four different types of Leading Digital Transformation.\n\nALEXANDRA KOLODINA\n\nExtended Reality Lead EMEA Medtronic\n\nWorking in change management and innovation, I looked for a programme with an end-to-end vision and a ‘people’ aspect beyond ‘digital’. The participants all face similar challenges, and it’s a relief to hear that you’re not alone. Leading Digital Transformation isn’t easy, but it starts with understanding your company’s culture and finding the right leadership styles. Combined with agility and the courage to take risks."

The programme really confirmed that there is no magic formula for increasing an organisation’s digital maturity. We discovered the variety of tasks, points of view, and number of people that should be involved to get to a good result. The main learning lesson is the necessity of a roadmap for the entire organisation – and this programme provided the tools.\n\n\n\n\nWOUTER VAN ISTERDAEL\n\nBusiness Unit Director IT Aldi Belgium\n\nIt was fascinating to talk to people active in diverse sectors and yet all facing the same issues. The programme also inspired me on a technological level – seeing examples set by the industry pioneers, the technological possibilities, and hearing the guest lecturers who have lived such a transformation first-hand and were eager to share their experiences with the group. Read more on Wouter's Vlerick experience.\n\nTAMARA LIEVENS\n\nHead of IT @MPET\n\nIn my current role as Head of IT I have the ability to engage at both the operational and the strategic level. This programme’s mix of theory, energy scan and tips & tools and the shared experiences in implementing digital transformations in practice has given me lots of insights and inspiration. One of the first actions taken in the organisation was to categorise the roadmap according to the four different types of Leading Digital Transformation.\n\nALEXANDRA KOLODINA\n\nExtended Reality Lead EMEA Medtronic\n\nWorking in change management and innovation, I looked for a programme with an end-to-end vision and a ‘people’ aspect beyond ‘digital’. The participants all face similar challenges, and it’s a relief to hear that you’re not alone. Leading Digital Transformation isn’t easy, but it starts with understanding your company’s culture and finding the right leadership styles. Combined with agility and the courage to take risks.\n\nFACULTY\nStijn Viaene\n\nProfessor of Digital Transformation\n\nStijn Viaene is dedicated to helping executives transform their enterprises for a digital world.\n\nKarlien Vanderheyden\n\nProfessor of Organisational Behaviour\n\nKarlien Vanderheyden focuses on how individuals can impact an organisation’s people, processes and performance.\n\nKoen Vingerhoets\n\nExecutive in Residence\n\nKoen Vingerhoets is one of Belgium’s leading experts in blockchain technology.\n\nGET IN TOUCH!\nAnastasia Kostina\n\nProduct manager\n\nANASTASIA.KOSTINA@VLERICK.COM\n+32 2 225 41 34\nBOOK AN APPOINTMENT"
