SOPHIE LIBOUTON

Team Manager Governance & Methods STIB-MIVB

Thanks to the 360° view of the ‘Mastering IT Management’ programme, I have a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of my organisation. Whatever role you have – IT or Business, Programme Manager or CIO – this programme helps you steer things with a different perspective and understanding. Read more.

PETER BEUSELING

Head of Unit Euratom IT support

It has been a week since the 'Mastering IT Management' programme, and the ideas just keep on coming. I now have so much more insight into IT and IT management, and I am starting to see better and better how I can apply this learning in my job. I will soon share my first ideas with our management, especially regarding the new organization of my unit and the structure and way of working that I want to implement. This fantastic programme is one of the best (if not the best) I've ever participated in!

PIETER GROEBBENS

Technical Relationship Manager - Businesses EMEA Corporate/Shared Services at BD

The programme elucidates a number of challenges in today's IT management – starting from theory and illustrated with practical examples. Your automatic reflex is to immediately apply best practices to your own business situation. Plus, Stijn Viaene’s enthusiasm is unforgettable.
