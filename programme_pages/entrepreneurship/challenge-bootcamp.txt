RUBEN BAESTAENS

Manager at Are Agency & Simba

One of Vlerick’s Entrepreneurs in Residence recommended the programme – and I’m extremely glad he did. Being able to work alongside like-minded participants is really valuable. You also get to stand back and evaluate your own business and approaches. And the network you build is invaluable.

CHRISTOPHE BOEXSTAENS

Manager at ALU-XTRA

The Challenge Bootcamp gave me the self-confidence and self-awareness to turn my weaknesses into strengths. My communication, leadership, innovation, organisational, sales and overall management skills have all improved. I now dare to say I am an entrepreneur. I even have to hold back a little, because the organisation cannot keep up with me! Thanks to this programme, I know I’ll be able to deliver on my long-term objectives.

CÉLINE CORTVRIENDT

Manager Cortvriendt Tegels NV

The programme gets you out of your comfort zone, which motivated me to do things better. In the past we sometimes used to be behind the curve, but now I plan– I made a list of action points for the coming year, for example. I'm also more aware of how important focus is. The discussions with other participants were really valuable too.
