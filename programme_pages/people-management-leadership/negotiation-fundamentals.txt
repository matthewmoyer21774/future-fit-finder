The Negotiation Fundamentals programme is not merely about tips & tricks for improving your negotiation skills − it really changes your negotiation mind-set, from ‘you win some, you lose some’ to ‘find value creation opportunities for both parties’. You can access this online training programme on a variety of devices, and the fact that it’s online means that you can use it flexibly at your convenience. Vlerick’s approach is academic, but the material is taught so that the learnings are applicable in your daily professional and personal lives. I highly recommend this programme for people and organisations interested in raising their negotiation style to the next level − which is value creation.
