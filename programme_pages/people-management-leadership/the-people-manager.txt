THIBAUD DE KEYZER

Sales Executive at SAP Belgium

The programme taught me how professional relationships should work and evolve under well-balanced people management. The key goal is growing people – and managing this growth is essential to keeping the best talent inside the company. Through different viewpoints, use cases and hands-on exercises, we quickly got to grips with a company’s most important asset: its people.
