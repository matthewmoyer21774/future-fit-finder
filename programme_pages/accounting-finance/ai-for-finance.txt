Today’s CFOs and finance leaders need more than technical expertise. They’re expected to shape strategic decisions, identify risks and opportunities – and guide their teams through rapid technological change.

AI is already transforming the finance function – and this programme empowers finance executives to navigate the AI era. You’ll learn to assess, implement and leverage AI technology to enhance forecasting, valuation, performance management, cost control and value creation. And you’ll leave with the skills and confidence to integrate AI into your finance strategy, driving transformation across your team.
