The programme is intended to be as interactive as possible.\n\nJULIE GOSSEN\n\nResponsible Investment Specialist at Degroof Petercam Asset Management\n\nThe networking opportunities were exceptional – with 2-day sessions in Ghent and Leuven. The programme enabled everyone to exchange insights and build strong bonds with our peers. The very diverse group of participants made this journey even more enriching, as everyone had a different take on how to apply the newly acquired knowledge to their respective careers.\n\nBJORN DE VRIESE\n\nJurist and Lecturer in Law at Hogeschool Ghent\n\nI chose Vlerick because it offers this flagship programme in the Benelux region, and I found no alternative that matched its quality. The modules – excellently designed, structured and delivered – cover a wide range of themes within the financial world.\n\nVlerick is a life-changing experience in my lifelong learning journey and career.
