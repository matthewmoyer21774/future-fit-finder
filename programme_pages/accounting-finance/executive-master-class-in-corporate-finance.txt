The role of finance is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic. Over the course of one year, the 21-day Executive Master Class in Corporate Finance will give you academic knowledge to underpin your financial expertise. You’ll live and learn analysis, solving complex financial issues. You’ll deepen your knowledge by choosing elective subjects. Then you’ll make the leap and apply everything you’ve learned to a challenge or opportunity in your own organisation.

DETAILED PROGRAMME

Build your knowledge and understanding in two broad phases. In the first, you dive deep into the fundamentals of corporate finance. Across four core modules, you learn how to make finance decisions, you develop finance strategies and work on capital budgeting and company valuation.

You get to live everything you learn in a business opportunity or challenge in your own organisation. 

Then in the second phase, you deepen your knowledge by choosing electives that best align with the needs of your company and your role. Choose, for example, the Mergers & Acquisition Path, to enhance your understanding of Creating Value through M&A and Venture Capital and Private Equity. Or follow the Leadership Path and dive deep into Self-Leadership and The People Manager. If you’d rather build your own path, we’d be happy to help you select your electives.
