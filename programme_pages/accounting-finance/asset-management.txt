ANTOINE POLEY

Client Reporting Officer at Candriam

Having just started my asset management career, this programme was ideal. It has been an intellectually enriching and stimulating experience. The programme is taught by skilled lecturers – true experts with exceptional knowledge to share. The programme is intended to be as interactive as possible.

JULIE GOSSEN

Responsible Investment Specialist at Degroof Petercam Asset Management

The networking opportunities were exceptional – with 2-day sessions in Ghent and Leuven. The programme enabled everyone to exchange insights and build strong bonds with our peers. The very diverse group of participants made this journey even more enriching, as everyone had a different take on how to apply the newly acquired knowledge to their respective careers.

BJORN DE VRIESE

Jurist and Lecturer in Law at Hogeschool Ghent

I chose Vlerick because it offers this flagship programme in the Benelux region, and I found no alternative that matched its quality. The modules – excellently designed, structured and delivered – cover a wide range of themes within the financial world.

Vlerick is a life-changing experience in my lifelong learning journey and career. I have gained a wealth of new knowledge for myself, not to mention the professional contacts and beautiful friendships.
