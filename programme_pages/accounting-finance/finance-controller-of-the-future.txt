--- DESCRIPTION ---
To drive value in today’s fast-changing world, finance professionals must transition from the role of “controller” to strategic business partner - and know how to reap the benefits of digitisation.

If you’re ready to make this transition, this five-day programme is for you. You’ll live and learn how to drive growth across your whole organisation – and be a sounding board, communications specialist and data analyst, all rolled into one. And you’ll leave with the tools to leap into tackling the challenges facing cross-functional teams.
